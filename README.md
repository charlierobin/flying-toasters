# My version of the old classic Flying Toasters screensaver

I started work on this years ago, and did a simpler version for Mac OSX that had some half-decent animations.

This was to be its replacement, done in Cinder/OpenGL. This was all 2013 or thereabouts. I got slightly waylaid along the way.

So now it's time to finish it all off.

(1) Finish the final animations and graphics.

(2) Sort out the code a bit, get rid of the worst mess ups, bodges, and who knows what else lurks in there.

(3) Put it into the Cinder screensaver framework. (It's just an app at the moment.)

(4) Make it cross platform.
