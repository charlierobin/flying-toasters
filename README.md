# My version of the old classic Flying Toasters screensaver

I started work on this years ago, and did a simpler version for Mac OSX that had some half-decent animations.

It’s not perfect, quite a bit of tidying up to be done around the place, but it’s a great start.

(At the moment the above is Intel Macs only, until I get Cinder for Apple Silicon compiled. Which I imagine is probably just a case of grabbing the latest dev version from the Cindeer Github page.)
